the net result of cash flow from operations and capital spending is free cash flow of 142 billion year to date our balance sheet is strong and provides us with financial flexibility we continue to maintain nearterm maturities at low levels which gives us confidence to operate through different financial market environments we ended the quarter with 1129 billion of total debt which was comprised of 1037 billion of unsecured debt and 92 billion of onbalance sheet securitizations,"['money', 'money', 'money', 'money', 'money', 'money']","['money', 'money', 'money', 'money', 'money', 'money']"

so lets start on 2018 obviously sales and earnings significantly above our expectations that we had going into the year and even above what our expectations were in november when we last updated guidance the beat of course was driven in large part by a lower effective tax rate and those were really the results of the finalization of some rulings rules from treasury that happened late in the year and i think importantly the beat was also driven by a much better rockwell collins performance after the acquisition,['date'],['date']
