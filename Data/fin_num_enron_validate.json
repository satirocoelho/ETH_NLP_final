At AIMR, your application package is bundled together and sent to\nme for approval. I send it back to AIMR, and they will alert you of your\nmembership status (and invoice you for dues) by mail. The whole process can\ntake five weeks or more, because AIMR only processes applications once a\nmonth.\n\nPlease call me if you have any more questions.\n\nDonna F.
